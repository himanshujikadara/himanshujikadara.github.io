                            <p>
                                My journey to where I am today has been shaped by a passion for technology and a 
                                relentless drive to solve complex challenges. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in 
                                Information Technology, which laid the foundation for my career in system analysis, 
                                project management, and web development. Starting my career as a developer in a 
                                small team of just two, I quickly realized my aptitude for understanding systems 
                                and finding efficient solutions. Over the years, I’ve grown both technically and 
                                as a leader, eventually managing teams of up to 20 developers. Along the way, I 
                                also ran my own company, which allowed me to further hone my entrepreneurial 
                                skills and deepen my understanding of business needs. I became an AWS Certified 
                                Solutions Architect and a Certified ScrumMaster®, which further enhanced my ability 
                                to lead agile-driven projects. Working with clients worldwide has expanded my skill 
                                set, allowing me to innovate and deliver scalable, impactful solutions. Today, I 
                                specialize in helping businesses navigate the complexities of the digital landscape, 
                                delivering results that exceed expectations and drive lasting success.

                                            I worked with Himanshu over a period of a year. 
                                            Together we managed the development of a B2B Trading Platform from start to finish.  
                                            It was an absolute pleasure working with Himanshu, who is extremely dedicated and professional. 
                                            Because he has a web developer background, he also has a great understanding of how to deliver 
                                            technical projects on budget and on time. Himanshu comes highly recommended.
